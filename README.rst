f5-openstack-lbaasv2
====================

|Docs Build Status|

Introduction
------------
This repo contains the code for F5®'s OpenStack LBaaSv2 plugin. The LBaaSv2
plugin allows you to orchestrate BIG-IP® load balancing services – including
virtual IPs, pools, device service groups, and health monitoring – in an
OpenStack environment.

Releases
--------
The latest release is v |release|. See the :ref:`Release Notes <release-notes>` for more information.

.. warning::

    Alpha and beta releases are **unsupported** development releases. We welcome feedback and bug reporting for these releases; see :ref:`Filing Issues <filing-issues>` for more information.


Documentation
-------------
See the `Documentation <http://f5-openstack-lbaasv2.rtfd.org/en/>`_ for installation and configuration instructions.

Compatibility
-------------
This plugin can be used with OpenStack releases from Liberty forward. If you are using an earlier release, you'll have to use the `LBaaSv1 plugin <https://github.com/F5Networks/openstack-f5-lbaasv1>`_.

Subprojects
-----------
The LBaaSv2 plugin comprises packages from different F5 Networks® projects:

 - `F5Networks/f5-openstack-lbaasv2-driver <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-lbaasv2-driver>`_
 - `F5Networks/f5-openstack-agent <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-agent>`_

Before You Begin
----------------
For release |release|, you will need to install the following dependencies your Neutron controller host *before* installing the F5® LBaaSv2 plugin packages.

.. topic:: Install the F5® SDK

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ pip install f5-sdk

.. topic:: Download the F5® LBaaSv2 service provider package and add it to the python path for ``neutron_lbaas``.

    Download from GitHub

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ curl -O https://github.com/F5Networks/neutron-lbaas/releases/download/v2.0.1a1/f5.tgz

    Install on CentOS:

    .. code-block:: text

        # tar xvf f5.tgz -C /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron_lbaas/drivers/

    Install on Ubuntu:


    .. code-block:: text

        # tar xvf f5.tgz –C /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/neutron_lbaas/drivers/


Installation
------------

You can download the driver and agent release packages directly from F5 Networks' GitHub repos using pip.

.. note::

    You must have both ``pip`` and ``git`` installed on your machine in order to use these commands. It may be necessary to use ``sudo``, depending on your environment.


.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-lbaasv2-driver@v2.0.1a1
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-agent@v2.0.1a1


Configuration
-------------

Neutron
~~~~~~~

You will need to make a few configurations in your Neutron environment in order to use the F5® OpenStack LBaasv2 plugin.

1. Edit the ``[service_providers]`` section of :file:`/etc/neutron/neutron_lbaas.conf` and add ``F5`` as the service provider. Comment out, or remove the default tag from, any other ``LOADBALANCERV2`` entries.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ vi /etc/neutron/neutron_lbaas.conf
        ...
        [service_providers]
        service_provider = LOADBALANCERV2:F5NetworksTest:neutron_lbaas.drivers.f5.driver_v2.F5LBaaSV2DriverTest:default
        ...

2. Edit the ``[DEFAULT]`` section of :file:`/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` and add the ``lbaasv2`` service plugin. If there is an entry for LBaaSv1 (``lbaas``), remove it.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ vi /etc/neutron/neutron.conf
        ...
        [DEFAULT]
        service_plugins = [already defined plugins],neutron_lbaas.services.loadbalancer.plugin.LoadBalancerPluginv2
        ...

3. Restart the ``neutron-server`` service.

    .. code-block:: text

        $ service neutron-server restart // Ubuntu
        $ systemctl restart neutron-server // CentOS


F5® LBaaSv2 Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configurable options supported in this release are noted below. See the agent configuration file -- :file:`/etc/neutron/services/f5/f5-openstack-agent.ini` -- for more information.

.. table::

    +---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Feature                         | Description                       |
    +=================================+===================================+
    | Global Routing Mode -           | Only global routing is supported; |
    |  ``f5_global_routed_mode``      | no L2 or L3 Segmentation.         |
    +---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Device Setting -                | External (hardware or VE) only.   |
    |  ``f5_device_type``             |                                   |
    +---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | HA model -                      | Standalone only; HA is not        |
    |  ``f5_ha_type``                 | available.                        |
    +---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | Sync Mode -                     | Replication only.                 |
    |  ``f5_sync_mode``               |                                   |
    +---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+


1. To use the available features, make sure the entries in the agent config file match those shown below.

.. code-block:: text

    $ vi /etc/neutron/services/f5/f5-openstack-agent.ini
    f5_global_routed_mode = True
    f5_ha_type = standalone
    f5_device_type = external
    f5_sync_mode = replication


2. Add the IP address, username and password of your BIG-IP® to the agent config file. This ensures that the agent can communicate with the BIG-IP®.

.. code-block:: text

    icontrol_hostname = <bigip_icontrol_ip_address>
    icontrol_username = <username>
    icontrol_password = <password>


3. Start the agent:

.. code-block:: text

    # systemctl enable f5-openstack-agent.service
    # systemctl start f5-openstack-agent.service



.. tip::

    To stop the agent, run

    .. code-block:: text

        # systemctl stop f5-openstack-agent.service


.. topic:: Troubleshooting

    If the agent will not run and/or you experience errors, be sure of the following:

    - The iControl® hostname, username, and password have been entered correctly.
    - All config settings pertaining to L2 and tunneling (e.g., ``f5_vtep_folder``, ``f5_vtep_selfip_name``, tunnel types) are commented out.


Usage
-----

.. note::

    OpenStack Horizon does not currently support LBaaSv2 services. All LBaaSv2
    configurations must be made via the CLI or REST API. The LBaaSv2 CLI commands all begin with ``lbaas``.

    `OpenStack CLI Documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/neutron.html>`_


The following restrictions apply for Neutron LBaaS objects in this release.

    fields in the pull request template.


Build
-----
To make a PyPI package:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python setup.py sdist


Test
----
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should
include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP® device
for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included
below.

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~

We use pytest for our unit tests.

1. If you haven't already, install the required test packages and the requirements.txt in your virtual
environment.

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the tests and produce a coverage report. The ``--cov-report=html``
   will create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your
   browser to see the missing lines of code.

.. code-block:: text

    $ py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html


Style Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of
step 1 in the Unit Test section).

.. code-block:: text

    $ flake8 ./
